Greetings!  This is the codebook file designed for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course project on UCI Human Activity Recognition (HAR) data. It accompanies the run_analysis.R script which handles the actual data tidying and manipulation.  The script outputs a file called 'BCarlton - GroupedAvgsByActivityAndSubj.txt' which is a dataset containing averages of all mean and standard deviation data from the UCI HAR Dataset grouped by activity and subject.

To best explain the nature of each of the variables, I will quote directly from the UCI HAR dataset's own readme file to give more detail into the nature of each of these variables:

"The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details.

-From the description above, you can quickly derive the following information about the naming schema:
	-Most of the variables in this set follow the following scheme: [GroupedAvg-][t or f][name from the UCI HAR dataset]
	-The GroupedAvg- prefix indicates that this is average of the particular variable from the UCI HAR dataset by activity and subject. Each cell is the grouped average of all entries of the intersection of a particular subject, activity and HAR variable. The prefix was added to distinguish these variables from the UCI HAR data for clarity's sake.
	-The [t or f] letter in front of the UCI HAR variable name indicates whether or not this is raw time (t) domain data or post Fourier transform frequency (f) domain data.
	-Finally, the UCI HAR variable names are many, and will be explained with each variable below.

-The dataset is simple considering the types of variables to be had.  With the exception of "activityDescription" and "subjectID", all of the variables are of the numeric type and, given normalization by the UCI HAR data team, all values will be found in the range of [-1, 1].

-Fourier transformed variables have units given by the original unit multiplied by the time unit being used e.g. a meters/(second)^2 unit will be fourier transformed to yield meters/second.
